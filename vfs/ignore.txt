.notshared should have the same behaviour as .gitignore:
Trailing spaces are ignored if not escaped with '\'.
# 		starts a comment
! 		negates a pattern
\ 		to escape characters, like ! at the start of a filename.
/ 		is the directory seperator, also on windows.
        / at the start or middle of a path means absolute paths relative to the notshared file.
        if that is not the case, the names are recursively matched.
        / at the end of a path means that only directories are matched.
* 			matches everything except a slash '/'
? 			matches every character except a slash '/'
[a-zA-Z] 	lexical character groups can be used to match one character.

**/foo		matches a file or directory anywhere, f. e. **/node_modules
**/foo/bar	matches any directory compination from .notshared onwards, i. e.  
a/**/b		
foo/**      matches all content in foo.
